# Crypto Asset Tracker - Sports Edition
Crypto Asset Tracker - Sports Edition (or CATsport for short) is an ASP.NET Web Application (.NET Framework) in the C# programming language. CATsport is an application that aims to provide an easy way for sports enthusiasts to visualize and manage sports-related, non-fungible token (NFT) assets across multiple platforms. Without question, the visibility, popularity, and accessibility of sports NFTs has been on the rise. While Version 1 of the application focuses on a single type of sports NFT (NBA's TopShot), I wanted to lay the foundation for a potentially beneficial tool for cross-platform collectors.
